This repository contains the datasets and code accompanying our paper “A probabilistic approach for collective similarity-based drug–drug interaction prediction.” See http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/20/3175.short for full details.

The code uses our Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) framework: https://github.com/linqs/psl/wiki

Dependencies: You need Java (https://java.com/en/download/) and Maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) in order to run the PSL experiments.

You can run cross-fold validation experiments across all datasets reported in our paper with the following command:
./run_cv.sh DrugInteractionPrediction

AUC and AUPR metrics will be reported per fold in result files created under “./output/psl”.

As described in the paper, the drug indices in dataset 2 can be mapped back to DrugBank - use the DrugBankIDs file. The row index is exactly the drug index and the entry in that row is the DrugBank ID.
